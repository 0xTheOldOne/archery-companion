  <p>
    This app is made with VueJS and is meant to be an all-in-one archery toolbox for those who need it, enjoy !<br />
    It contains :
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A tool based on the meditation app called "Calm", it may help if you're stressed and need to breath</li>
    <li>A simple timer for your training sessions, with sounds</li>
    <li>A tool that mimic a virtual opponent, you will be able to compete against it according to the <i>level</i> of mastery you chose and you will see the match results</li>
  </ul>
  <p><i>Maybe</i> i'll try to merge the timer and the virtual opponent tool so you can shoot against someone with a match timer !</p>
